# Top N Records Per Group in SQL
**By Kazi Mohammad Ali Nur (Romel)**

## üß† What is ROW_NUMBER()?

`ROW_NUMBER()` is a **window function** that assigns a unique, sequential number to each row within a result set, based on a specified sort order.

You can use `PARTITION BY` to reset the numbering **within each group**, and `ORDER BY` to define how rows are sorted before numbers are assigned.

### üìò Example:
Suppose you want to rank students by their score:

```sql
SELECT student, score,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS rank
FROM results;
```

This produces:

| student | score | rank |
|---------|-------|------|
| Alice   | 95    | 1    |
| Bob     | 90    | 2    |
| Carol   | 85    | 3    |

If you add `PARTITION BY class`, the numbering restarts for each class.

> In our solution, we'll use `ROW_NUMBER()` to identify the **top N products per city**, based on total quantity sold.

## üìò What is a CTE?

A **CTE (Common Table Expression)** is a temporary result set defined using the `WITH` keyword. It allows you to write **complex queries in a readable, modular way**, especially when working with window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`.

Think of it like a named subquery that you can reference as if it's a table:

```sql
WITH ranked_sales AS (
  SELECT ...
)
SELECT ...
FROM ranked_sales
WHERE ...
```

> In this tutorial, we‚Äôll use a CTE to isolate the ranked rows before filtering out the top N per group.
